          "explanation": "In Python 3, the `/` operator (true division) always performs floating-point division, even if both operands are integers and the result is a whole number. Therefore, `10 / 3` results in `3.333...`, which is a float type.",

          "explanation": "In Python, when an immutable object (like an integer) is passed to a function, a copy of the value is assigned to the local parameter `x`. Inside the function, `x = x + 5` modifies this local copy. The original `value` variable in the global scope remains unchanged. The function returns the modified local `x` (which is 15), but `print(value)` specifically prints the original global variable `value`, which is still `10`.",
